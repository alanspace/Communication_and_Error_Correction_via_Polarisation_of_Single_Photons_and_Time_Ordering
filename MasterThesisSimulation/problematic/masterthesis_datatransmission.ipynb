    "This chapter examines data communication in the context of error correction. In transmitting a message from a sender to a receiver through a channel, such as air or a data cable, noise may be introduced, leading to errors in the received message. While high power signal amplification and short channels are ideal for minimizing errors, they may not be feasible in practice. For instance, GSM telephones and Ethernet cables are designed to conserve energy and transmit over long distances, respectively, hence codewords are encoded to reduce energy usage and enable long-distance transmission. The encoded message is transmitted over the channel, where errors may occur, necessitating the decoding of the received codeword into the original message. The encoding and decoding processes are illustrated in Figures 1.1 and 1.2."

    "In the framework of error correction, this chapter looks at data communication. Noise may be added during the transmission of a message from a sender to a receiver across a channel, like the air or a data cable, causing errors in the message that is received. While short channels and high power signal amplification are excellent for reducing errors, they might not be practical in real-world applications. For example, GSM phones and Ethernet connections are made to use less energy and transmit data over long distances, respectively. As a result, codewords are encoded to use less energy and support transmission over long distances. The encoded communication must be decoded into the original message after being received across a channel that may experience mistakes. Figures 1.1 show the encoding and decoding procedures."

    "The communication process involves the transmission of a message or information from a source to a receiver over a channel. The source message is initially in analog form and must be converted into a digital representation that can be transmitted.

The output of the source encoder is the source codeword, which is a digital representation of the source message that can be transmitted.\n",
